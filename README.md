#GIFT LIST

in this i have implemented merkle tree data structure, i have also used `ethereum-cryptography` library to hash the items.

to run the project just `cd` to the folder and then run `npm install`
after installing the dependencies run the express server `node server/index.js` or `nodemon server/index.js`
after that in the client run the js file `node client/index.js`
